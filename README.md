🧠 Second Mind – Towards Autonomous Intelligence
"Systems that don't just respond—they think, reflect, and evolve."
— Vishnu

📌 Overview
Second Mind is a modular, multi-agent intelligence system built to simulate human-like reasoning. It moves beyond simple question answering to a layered thought process that involves generation, self-reflection, scoring, improvement, and final synthesis. Inspired by metacognition, this system represents a leap toward agentic, self-evaluating AI systems.

🚀 Features
🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture – Modular cognitive pipeline with specialized agents for each task.

🔄 Reflection and Evolution – Agents critique and refine their own outputs in multiple passes.

📊 Ranking and Scoring – Evaluates responses for quality, novelty, and relevance.

🧠 Meta-Reasoning – System reflects on its own reasoning path for deeper insights.

📚 Context-Aware Memory – Memory-enhanced reasoning using vector stores or embeddings.

⚙️ Agent Workflow
The Second Mind system orchestrates thought through the following agents:


Agent	Role Description
Supervisor Agent	Orchestrates workflow between agents and controls transitions.
Generation Agent	Gathers external info and proposes initial hypotheses.
Reflection Agent	Evaluates the logical consistency and completeness of the hypothesis.
Ranking Agent	Scores all possible hypotheses based on various quality metrics.
Evolution Agent	Refines or re-generates outputs based on prior critiques.
Proximity Agent	Checks semantic closeness of response to the original query.
Meta Review Agent	Conducts a high-level reasoning audit across the system.
Summary Agent	Compiles and presents the final, optimized answer.
